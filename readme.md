# ZSH Functions

This project is a compilation of useful zsh functions either created by me or copied from annother sources and adapted to my needs. The goal is to improve
productivity by eliminating unnecesary manual tasks. Some of the function come very handy if used as scripts in Alfred workflows ðŸ¤“
